# Text Summarization Using Regex
This code demonstrates the use of Natural Language Processing libraries and tools like NLTK and Spacy, and regular expressions. It summarizes a bunch of long texts and new articles into concise and accurate summaries. The code is an application of a Sequence-2-Sequence model, which is designed for tasks involving sequential data. It takes an input sequence, processes it, and generates an output sequence.
